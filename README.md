## Steps to run the viewer from scratch

Get the code:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv-angular.git
```

Move to its folder:
```sh
cd dwv-angular
```

Install dependencies (using `yarn`, replace with `npm` if you prefer):
```sh
yarn install
```

Call the start script to launch the viewer on a local server:
```sh
yarn run start
```

You can now open a browser at http://localhost:4200 and enjoy!

## Available Scripts

# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:4200

# run linting
yarn run lint

# run unit tests with hot reload
yarn run test

# run e2e tests
yarn run e2e

# build (add --prod for production)

```
